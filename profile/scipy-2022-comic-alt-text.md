# Front Cover
## Title: How to Write Alt Text for Scientific Diagrams and Illustration
## Publisher: Quansight Labs

A person, known as Ally, dramatically jumps down to the center of the cover. They're holding a sign titled "ALT". They have a bandana covering their eyes like a superhero domino mask, similar to Batman. They are grinning widely and challenge the reader by saying "Join our sprints to make the world more accessible!"

In the background is Ally's home, a futuristic cyberpunk city. Tall, elaborate skyscrapers loom behind them and large billboards with glowing graphs shine through the night sky. In the bottom right corner of each billboard is their alt text property, represented as a sticker labelled 'Alt'.

The bottom of the cover contains several elements:
- Author and Artist: Mars Lee
- QR code to digital version of this comic book that has alt text
- Price: $0.00
- Sticker: A snake circling around the words 'SciPy 2022 edition'

## Panel 1
Two people are walking down a dingy, cyberpunk alleyway. In the alleyway are faintly visible glowing signs with restaurant logos and graphs. Discarded wrappers are stewn on the floor and pipes ominously puff out whisps of smoke. This city may not be the cleanest or most up-to-date, but its the most colorful and exciting city in the world.

The two people are 'Ally' and 'Friend'.

Friend and Ally are walking down the alleyway, not minding the grime of the city. They've known each other and the city for a long time. The two of them are are chatting happily.

Friend is using a white cane to navigate. It has a rollable marshmellow tip. It is non-collapsible- he prefers the extra sensitivity. He wears a cool pair of sunglasses.

Ally as a bandana across their head, like an 80s aerobics instructor or Rambo wannabe.

## Panel 2
Ally suddenly stops in front of the City Ramen sign
Ally: Hey, this is our stop! Yum yum!
Friend doesn’t stop with Alley. Keeps walking a little more.

## Panel 3
Friend looks back, slightly confused.
Friend: Oh, yeah, sorry. My screenreader didn’t detect anything. 

## Panel 4 
Ally angrily points at the City Ramen sign. The sign has a sticker labeled ‘Alt Text’ in the bottom left corner. 
Ally: Ugh, it didn’t? That means this sign is inaccessible!
Friend: Let me check with my screen reader.

## Panel 5
Friend tries to scan Alt Text label with his screen-reader. The screen-reader looks like a barcode scanner. It's a cyberpunk, physical representation for the screen-reader software used in computers and phones.

The screen-reader reads out “Alt Text: <empty>”
Friend: Hmmm, I'll check the menu too.

## Panel 6
Friend scans a different sign next to the “City Ramen” sign. The sign is the menu for City Ramen. The scanner reads '<Alt Text: Menu for City Ramen.>'

The full menu put on the sign reads
Menu for City Ramen
Broth base
Shoyu: $11
Gochujang: $12
Tonkotsu: $15
Toppings
Extra pork: $2.50
Boiled egg: $1.50
Extra sesame: $1
Extra scallions: $1

Most of these details are not in the sign's alt text and therefore not read out to Friend.

Friend: Well, this has some alt text. But it doesn't list what’s actually on the menu.

## Panel 7
Ally: I can read it out loud for you.

Friend looks down, body pointing away from Friend.
Friend: I know, and I appreciate it. I just... want to do it myself sometimes… I wish more images had alt text.

# Page 2
## Panels 1, 2, and 3
Ally is sad, shoulders slumped in defeat. Then Ally is suddenly angry, dark lines swirling their head like a storm. Then they have an idea, as the storm above their head subsides and turns into a lightbulb going off above their head.
  
## Panel 4:
Ally: Fine! If they won't add alt text to their own signs....

## Panel 5:
Ally dramatically pulls out a crayon from their pocket.
Ally: I'll do it myself!

## Panel 6:
Ally hastily scribbles alt text into the alt text property of the City Ramen sign.
Ally: I'll add alt text here!
  
## Panel 7, 8, 9
Ally runs down the alleyway, adding alt text to more and more signs.
Ally: And over here! 

Ally stretches up to a different sign.
Ally: And here!

Ally is now visibly tired, sweat pouring off their brown as their legs stumble.
Ally: ... And ... and here...

## Panel 10
Ally looks up to a giant billboard that takes up the majority of the panel. It is advertising a data analysis company known as 'Data Wizards' in a humorous way. In the center of the billboard is a big histogram.

Ally's mouth is hanging open. Their crayon, previously poised with confidence, hangs in mid-air.

Alley: Actually, what is this? It's got a bunch of math stuff... and a graph going up and down?
  
# Page 3

## Panel 1, 2
Intertwined panels of Friend and Ally talking to each other. Friend is walking down the alleyway towards where Ally ran off. Friend is smiling, slighly amused at Ally's perplexity. Ally is staring and shrugging at the histogram in the billboard.

Friend: What does the graph look like? Does it have an X and Y axis?

Ally: It's like a bar chart but all squished together. And the X axis and Y axis is about cows.

## Panel 2, 3, 4
Continued intertwined panels of Friend and Ally talking to each other.

Friend: Oh, sounds like a histogram! What are the units on the X and Y axis?

Ally is a little less afraid of math now. They point at the histogram and stroke their chin.
Ally: It's... a cow weight on the X axis... and frequency on the y axis...

Now Ally is on a roll, feeling much more confident about writing alt text about a histogram.

## Panel 5, 6
Ally jumps up, slamming their hands on the billboard, having just finished writing alt text.  A action bubble captioned 'DONE!' surronds them. Friend is walking by, having finally caught up with Ally.

Friend when turns around and scans the alt text property of the billboard using his screen-reader. The screen-reader beeps loudly. Ally looks on expectantly.

## Panel 7
The billboard takes up the majority of the panel again, but this time the billboard is covered by a giant speech bubble. The speech bubble is the alt-text Friend's screen-reader is reading out loud.

The screen-reader reads out:
"A billboard advertising the data analytics company, Data Wizards. A crystal ball projects a histogram about cows. The cow’s weight is in kilograms on the X axis. The frequency is on the Y axis. The distribution of symmetrical. The caption reads ”Predict trends with your company’s data! Make your mooooove with confidence!”"

Friend has a wide smile on his face. Ally is looking both up and at Friend. They are finally processing the absurdity of the billboard's humor and how important alt text is to Friend.

## Panel 8, 9, 10, 11
Three panels are arranged in a sunrise pattern. Friend is laughing in each of these three panels, as if he were the sun itself. In the middle and therefore lowest center of the sunrise, is the last panel, where Friend is looking up in earnest, eagerly absorbing Friend's reaction.

### Panel 8
Friend's hands are covering the bottom of his face, barely holding back his laughter.
Friend: Haha, all those extra little details about the graph...

### Panel 9
Friend then lets go, releasing his hands, letting them fly as as he erupts into laughter. Swirling visual elements of the histogram, such as the graph lines and bars, dance around him like sunbeams and sparkles.
Friend: I understand all of it! Every part!

### Panel 10
Friend now has calmed down a little, now gently grapsing his cane back to his body.
Friend: And I get the context. An ad about cows and data, huh? Thank you for doing this for me.

# Page 4
## Panel 1
Ally erupts into righteous fury, suddenly and comically gaining rippling biceps for exactly this one moment. Fire dance around them, reflecting the intesity in their eyes.
Ally: I'll add alt text for everything in this city!

## Panel 2
Friend shrugs and gestures to the looming alleyway filled to the brim with signs.
Friend: But this whole alleyway is filled with signs without alt text. It would take you a long time to do it all by yourself.

## Panels 3, 4, 5
These panels are very similar to earlier in the comic, when Ally first thought about writing alt text by themselves.

Ally is sad, shoulders slumped in defeat. Then Ally is suddenly angry, dark lines swirling their head like a storm. Then they have an idea, as the storm above their head subsides and turns into a lightbulb going off above their head.

## Panel 6
Ally hastily plays off Friend's reality check. They place a hand on their forehead, as if they already anctipated this and only feiged ignorance. A sparkle flies off their face, as they imitate a charming anime character.

Ally: Of course.

## Panel 7
Ally dramatically pulls of their bandana off their forehead.
Ally: I don't have to do everything myself!

## Panel 8
Ally now ties the bandana across their eyes, like a domino mask worn by heros hiding their identity such as Zorro or Batman.

Ally: I'll recruit others.

# Panel 9, 10, 11, 12
Three panels are arranged in a sunrise pattern, similar to the previous page. Ally is present in each of these three panels. In the middle and therefore lowest center of the sunrise, is the last panel, where Ally is waving their arms around as stars shoot out of them and the caption reads "Alt Text Task Force".

### Panel 9
Ally points to a chalkboard with the words "Alt" on it. Two imaginary people in scholar's cap look on at Ally, absorbing the knowledge being shared.
Ally: I'll teach people how to write alt text.

### Panel 10
The two newly minted scholars now eagerly write alt text for their own signs.
Ally: Then we'll add alt text, alley by alley, for the whole city.

### Panel 11
The two scholars now high-5 each other, having completed their alt text. Ally cheers from a distance.
Ally: Together, we are the "Alt Text Task Force"!

## Panel 12
Ally puts their hand to their forehread, searching far and wide. Their other hands graps the comic panel, leaning against the forth wall.
Ally: And the first person I'll recruit is...

## Panel 13
Ally snaps their hand around, now pointing directly at you, dear reader.
Ally: You!

## Panel 14
Ally leans so far forward their head breaks the comic panel again, now fully breaking the forth wall.
Ally: Join us in writing alt text! Let's make this city more accessible!

# Page 5
The next few pages break away from the narrative format of the previous pages. These pages are more informal and direct, like a worksheet filled with excercises for a class.

## Panel 1
Ally: Since you SciPy folks are pretty smart, could you write alt text for these graphs?

Friend: To write alt text for graphs, here are some general principles:
- Identify the graph type
- Explain the data on the X and Y axis
- Summarize the overall trend
- Keep it short. 3 sentences is good.

## Panel 2
A scatterplot about cheese. The X axis is rating of the cheese, on a scale to 1 to 5. The Y axis is the cheese age in months. There are two main data clusters, with the first cluster around young cheeses with lower ratings and older cheese with higher ratings.

An empty box, to be filled with the reader's alt text for the scatterplot. A pencil wiggles at the side, signaling to write here.

## Panel 3
Friend: This one doesn't have X or Y axis! Try it out!

A pie chart titled 'Consumer Cheese Preferences'. The cheeses and their percentages are as follows:
- Cheddar, 40%
- Mozzarella, 30%
- Parmesan, 17%
- Brie, 13%

Another empty box, to be filled with the reader's alt text for the pie chart.

# Page 6
## Panel 1
Friend and Ally are both holding comics books- in fact, the very same comic you are reading right now! Ally is staring at their comic book while Friend looks to the side, casually holding his comic more like a prop.

Friend: Compare the alt text you wrote on the previous page with a friend's comic... How are your answers similar or different?

Ally is quickly looking between their comic and Friend's, absolutely bewildered.
Ally: So who is correct?

Friend: No one's alt text is neccessarily correct. As long as your alt text make it more clear what the image is, it's helpful!

## Panel 2
In big quotation marks, a caption that reads "For more information, refer to Fig. 1".

## Panels 3, 4, 5, 6
These following panels have Friend and the eponymous graph labelled 'Fig. 1'.

### Panel 3
The alt text property reads 'Empty'
Fig. 1 is a blacked out, a complete mystery to everyone regardless of visual ability.

Friend has a blank expresssion, quite unamused.

Friend: What? No idea.

### Panel 4
The alt text property reads 'A graph'.
Fig. 1 is clearing up, the black lines receeding to the corners. A few possible graphs are in the middle, such as a pie chart, a line graph and bar chart.

Friend is now both intrigued and annoyed. We're getting closer, but not close enough.

Friend: But what kind of graph?

### Panel 5
The alt text property reads:
A histogram about cows. The cow’s weight is kilograms on the X axis. The cow’s age on the Y axis. A cow's weight sharply increases with age, stabilizes and goes down slightly.

Fig. 1 now clearly display a histogram, with age in the X axis and kilograms on the Y axis.
Friend now smiles, giving a double thumbs up.

### Panel 6
The alt text property reads:
A histogram describing the relationship between a cow's weight and height.. On the X axis is the cow’s weight in kg. On the Y axis is the cow’s age in years. The histogram is bell shaped and peaks at 600kg.


Fig. 1 now clearly display a symmetrical histogram, with a line in the center, where the X axis is marked '600'.
Friend still smiling, giving a double thumbs up again!

## Panel 7
Closing this series of panels, a caption that reads "Some alt text is better than no alt text!"

## Panel 8
Ally holds up a magnifing glass to their eye.
Ally: But… aren’t you supposed to be really specific in math and science? π = 3.14… or is it 3.15? Isn’t it all the same?

## Panel 9
Friend jumps in, eager to share.
Friend: Well, actually… π is an irrational number that has a value of 22/7. In many contexts, we use approximations of π, such as 3.14 when calculating the perimeter of a circle. To 39 decimal places, π is 3.1415926…

Ally is gently pushed aside by this large speech bubble Friend has made. Ally smiles knowingly and allows Friend to explain. This ain't their first π rodeo.

# Page 7
## Panel 1
Ally now jumps in to explain the bigger, guiding answer anyone, not just math nerds, can use in writing alt text.

Ally: Context! How much alt text should we write? Depends on the context. Sometimes we only want a short summary of an image...

Friend sheepishly smiles in response, knowing sometimes he over-explains what he loves.

## Panel 2, 3, 4
These following panels have Friend using his screen-reader on three different signs for three different restaurants.

### Panel 2
The screen-reader reads out:
Cowabunga Pizza menu. Options include pepperoni, anchovies-

Friend cuts off the screen-reader. This isn't what he's looking for.
Friend: Nah...

### Panel 3
The screen-reader reads out:
Shredder's Cheese. Artisinal cheeses starting from $6-

Friend cuts off the screen-reader again. This isn't what he's looking for either.
Friend: Nah...

### Panel 4
The screen-reader reads out:
City Ramen menu. Customization of broth, toppings-
Friend cuts off the screen-reader, this time in joy. This is what he's been looking for.

Friend: Boo-yah!

## Panel 5
A caption reads 'In other times, we want all the details!'

Friend is now scanning a large menu for City Ramen with his screen-reader. He strokes his chin, thinking deeply of dinner.

The screen-reader reads out:
Menu for City Ramen.
Broth Base:
- Shoyu: $11
- Mushroom: $12
- Pork $15
Toppings:
- Boiled egg: $2
- Extra scalltions: $1
- Chili oil: $1

Friend: Am I in the mood for Shoyu or Mushroom? And why do I need to pay extra for the egg?

## Panel 6
Friend: If I need a very specific answer from a graph that short alt text wouldn't give me, then we have the option of
- Providing long alt text (longer than 3 sentences)
- Providing the information as a table

I can use my screen-reader to jump between columns and rows, exploring and finding what I need.

## Panel 8
Friend: I need a very specific answer for this: When is the best age for my cow to enter the "Biggest Cow Competition" at the country fair?

A bar chart showing the relationship between a cow's age in years on the X axis. and weight in kilograms on the Y axis. A cow's age steadily increases with age but peaks and declines at a certain point.

## Panel 7
A table containing the same information as the bar chart.
Note: This table is provided as plain text and a Markdown table.

### Plain text description of table
A table with two columns and five rows. The first section is the cow's age in years. The first section is the cow's weight in kilograms.
- Year 1, 100kg
- Year 2, 150kg
- Year 3, 300kg
- Year 4, 600kg
- Year 5, 500kg

### Markdown table
| Age (years) | Weight (kg) |
|-------------|-------------|
| 1           | 100         |
| 2           | 150         |
| 3           | 300         |
| 4           | 600         |
| 5           | 500         |


A cow's head pokes from behind the table. She has luxious horns, a curious snout and an adorable cow-bell tied around her neck.

Friend walks along, gently prodding the columns of the table with his cane. While he is not literally using a cane to access digital information, this example lets sighted readers imagine navigating a digital landscape, such as a table, in a similar way to navigating a physical landscape, such as an alleyway.
Friend: Ah, the best age is 4 years, at 600kg!

# Page 8
## Panel 1
Ally: In the context of documentation for Scientific Python projets, there's usually enough details surronding the graph.

## Panel 2
A web browswer with a page representing the typical page of documentation for a Scientific Python project. In this case, it is NumPy, on the about histograms.

### Long details of documentation example
The page has an example histogram, the details too small to make out. The page reads:
The NumPy histogram function applied to an array returns a pair of vectors: the histogram of the array and a vector of the bin edges. Beware: matplotlib also has a function to build histograms (called hist, as in Matlab) that differs from the one in NumPy. The main difference is that pylab.hist plots the histogram automatically, while numpy.histogram only generates the data.

The code snippet reads:
- import numpy as np
- rg = np.random.default_rng(1)
- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
- Build a vector of 10000 normal deviates with variance 0.5^2 and mean 2

## Panel 3
A tsumani wave of words surge up and around Friend.
Friend: However, I might get lost in this sea of text!

## Panel 4
Friend is now safe from the wave, having shored up onto an island. The island has a flag with a histogram on it. The flag reads out its alt text "A normalized histogram...". Friend is relieved now that everything makes sense.

A caption reads:
Alt text summmarizes the most important parts. An island after a sea of text.

## Panel 5
A caption reads:
This is just the tip of the iceberg. In blog posts, release notes, contributor guidelines, there's all sorts of curveballs we're still figuring out.

## Panel 7
Four examples of curveballs found in the wide world of Scientific Python. The examples include:
- Screenshots
- Memes
- Flowcharts
- Header images

## Panel 8
Friend: It will take time for these to become accessible. But once it is, I'll want to learn everything! I have so much data about cows... Cowabunga!

# Page 9
## Panel 1
A caption, serving as a hook:
Find out more in out next issue at EuroSciPy 2022! In our next issues, watch our heroes face even bigger challenges, such as...
- Commmunity involvement
- Sustainability
- Other types of accessibility

## Panel 2
Friend and Ally are hanging out on a couch. This is their post-credits scence, now that they're done with work. Friend is chewing on a pizza slice from Cowabunga Pizza, enjoying his hard-earned dinner. Ally has already left their dinner, a bowl from City Ramen, on the floor. Instead, Ally is rapidly mashing buttons on their SNES video game controller. Allly is leaning precariously forward towards the TV, one part of their mind on winning this level, the other on a wild food combination.

Ally: Hear me out... cheese ramen...
Friend: OK...
Ally: With anchovies!
Friend: Nope.

## Panel 3
Ally: If you want to start applying what you learnt, hoin us in our accessibility sprints during SciPy 2022!

An asterik marks a footnote reading 'Original concept developed by Isabela Presedo-Floyd and Tony Fast of Qunasight Labs".

Sprint attendees can make contributions via the Github Suggestions feature, which can be submitted via web browser.

So you could submit your contribution from your phone while in line for lunch!

By using Github Suggestions, we
- lower barriers
- get more first time contributors
- maintain individual credit
- highlight non-code contributions

## Panel 4
Two people in line for lunch near the SciPy conference center. Person A looks up from their phone, playing it cool and trying to flirt. Person B is happily engrossed in their phone.

Person A: What's for lunch?
Person B: Adding alt text to Bokeh!

## Panel 5
Person A is caught a little off-guard, but wants to impress Person B by joining in. Person B smiles, looking up at Person A.

Person A: Wait, how do you do that?
Person B: By scanning the QR codes on the next page!

## Panel 6
A caption reads 'Just like in the story, you can scan the world around you!'

A phone scans a QR code and emits a beep. The QR code leads to the accessibility sprint website. 

# Page 10
## Panel 1

Accessibility Sprint: SciPy 2022 Edition

There are four QR codes, one for each project involved in the sprint. The four projects are Dask, SciPy, Bokeh and JupyterLab.

Format: In-person (at SciPy) and Remote
Target Audience: Everyone! Especially if you read this comic.

If you need any help, look for the Quansight table at SciPy! Our guides, such as the comic author, Mars Lee, will be there.

## Panel 2
Refer to this cheatsheet during the sprint!
General principles:
- Identify the graph type
- Explain the data on the X and Y axis
- Summarize the overall trend
- Keep it short. 3 sentences is good.

Checklist:
- Correct spelling and no typos
- Periods and commas where relevant

Friend happily sings into a microphone. Below him is a QR code.
Friend: Thank you! Here's a special, secret gift, just for you!
This QR code leads to a video of Rick Ashley's "Never Gonna Give You Up". You, dear reader, and everyone else who scanned this code, has been "Rickrolled".

# Back Cover
## Panel 1
Ally: These projects need alt text! Help them now at SciPy 2022! Add alt text to multiple projects! Work together or seperately! It's a week-long, asynchronous project!

Four projects, represented by their logos, are floating around some example web pages. The four projects are Dask, SciPy, Bokeh and Jupyter. Each project has a corresponding pull request (PR).

People are standing on top of the web pages, as if they were paper maps on the floor. These are the contributors. One person is adding an alt text property to a image in the Dask documentation. Another person is jumping across web pages, to join the SciPY documentation PR. Their friend, already on the SciPy documentation page, is waving them over as they jump.

Ally is in the middle of the scence, jumping up and between both project's pages.

## Panel 2
Ally and the contributors are putting their hands out, pushing their powers to the center of the panel. At the center of the panel is the Dask logo, with the words "Alt" floating aroun dit.
Ally: With your powers combined...

## Panel 3
Now the Dask documentation page has been transformed! Ally and contributors show off the new page, as Friend gives a thumbs up.
Ally: We can make projets more accessible!

## Panel 4
People with disabilities learn and contribute to science and math everyday. Let's make it easier for everyone to access these very powerful tools of Scientific Python!

## Panel 5
Friend is standing in front of an image from the Dask documentation, which now has alt text.
Friend: Now I understand how Dask dataframes work! Why was I paying $$$ for < Redacated Commercial Software > when I could have used Dask instead?!

## Panel 6
One last thing... if you add alt text to all four projects, come back to the Quansight table for a special gift!
Two people at the Quansight table. The contributor has their hands up in celebration, their mouth udulating as they shout "Woooo!". The person at the table hands them a box marked with a question mark, that looks a lot like the blocks from the Mario video game series.

End of entire comicbook. P.S: Thanks for reading!
